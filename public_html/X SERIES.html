Think of the X1 as a tall hatchback—rather than a little SUV—with the usual BMW traits: 
a sporty suspension, precise steering, and a spirited engine. The all-new X1 now offers 
a roomier interior that is well-appointed and quiet. A turbo 2.0-liter four makes 228 hp 
and pairs with an eight-speed automatic; all-wheel drive is standard.

The X2 will be a sportier, coupe version of the X1. Specifically, 
the X2 should be identical to the X1 from the front bumper toward the B-pillar and 
feature a sloping roofline and slightly revised rear fascia.
he X2 will get the same drivetrains consisting of gasoline three-cylinder,
gasoline four-cylinder, and diesel four-cylinder engines. The crossover 
will be offered with both front-wheel and all-wheel drive.

 Updated in 2010, the X3 ditched its weird-looking front fascia in 
favor of a nose that resembled the X5’s. The second-gen crossover also saw production 
move from Graz, Austria, to BMW’s U.S. factory in Greer, South Carolina. As a result, 
the X3 entered the North American market as a locally built vehicle with a more affordable 
sticker. For 2015, BMW offers the X3 in three guises, with the engine lineup including 2.0-
liter, four-cylinder and 3.0-liter,inline-six gasoline units, as well as a 2.0-liter diesel mill.

The X4 has an upgraded version of its original engine. In this case, 
it’s the familiar 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder with forced induction thanks to turbocharging. 
The result of BMW’s massaging is an extra 55 horsepower and 43 pound-feet of torque. 
Matching the extra power are performance-oriented Michelin tires wrapped on your choice of 19- 
or 20-inch wheels motivated by a standard AWD system.But more on those details later.

The X5 first hit American shores in the 2000 model year as BMW’s first-ever journey into 
the realm of SUVs. The German automaker followed it up with the X3, 
and now as we near the 2016 model year, BMW has grown a healthy selection of SUVs 
to choose from. A new addition to the X5 lineup is coming for 2016, in the form of 
the X5 xDrive40e plug-in hybrid, as BMW tries to stay ahead of the times with this 
fuel-sipping people-hauler.A 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six is standard; a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 
and a turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are optional.

BMW released the X6 in 2008 and revealed a revised version in the middle of 2012. 
These changes were the last the first-gen SUV would receive because, starting 
2015.
BMW begins selling the second-generation X6. The BMW X6 has quickly become a successful 
model mostly due to the fact that it doesn’t have much competition. That won’t change too 
soon, it packs a 567-horsepower and 553-pound-feet V-8 powerplant. 
but Mercedes-Benz is prepping coupe SUVs of its own.

When it comes to the possibility of a BMW X7,we finally received official confirmation of 
the range-topping X-Series model. The announcement came out of left field, and
 was buried deep in a press release regarding the company’s South Carolina plant. 
The reason it ended up in this release was because it will be the newest addition 
to the plant’s workflow in 2016. Despite being built here in the U.S., the X7 will 
be a part of BMW’s global market,with a lot of the demand coming from the growing Chinese market.
