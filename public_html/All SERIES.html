Fresh, modern and straightforward
that’s the impression  created by the 
interior of the BMW 1 Series at first glance. 
And then confirmed at second glance. 
The cockpit has typical BMW driver orientation and the whole interior is characterised
 by top-quality design right down to the last detail.

Conformity for the nonconformist: when you take a seat behind 
the wheel of the BMW 2 Series Coupé you enter the limelight. This is

The interior is spacious, with practical storage possibilities and a functional,
 uncluttered instrument panel. At the same time, it is dominated by elegance and dynamics.

the outstanding quality. In typical BMW style, the cockpit is orientated systematically 
towards the driver, 
making it extremely easy to operate.

Power comes from a hybrid drivetrain consisting of a 231-horsepower turbocharged 
1.5-liter three-cylinder engine located behind the seats and a 131-horsepower 
electric motor mounted on the front axle. The gas-burning engine sends power 
to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission, while the electric 
motor spins the front wheels through a two-stage automatic gearbox.

The Z4 is a sporty, two-seat ragtop that comes in three flavors. 
The base 2.0-liter four-cylinder sDrive28i is offered with either a 
six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic; there are two 3.0-liter 
twin-turbo sixes: the 300-hp sDrive35i and the 335-hp sDrive35is. 
The former is offered with a six-speed stick or seven-speed dual-clutch auto, 
while the sDrive35is is offered only with the automatic. Regardless of the model, however, 
the Z4 is not one of our favorite sports cars.
