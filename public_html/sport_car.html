The BMW 1M was among the first proper M cars to use turbocharging; 
it may have vexed the purists, but its engine is a belter and a big part of its appeal. 
Driving the rear wheels via lovely slick six-speed manual gearbox is a 335bhp twin-turbo 
3-litre straight-six engine. In the 1495kg 1M Coupe, it yields a 4.8sec 0-60 time 
and an electronically limited 155mph top speed, though 
we’ve seen an indicated 170mph on derestricted German autobahn.

As the M range moves higher up in price, the M2 puts its performance 
back in reach of mere mortals. Under the hood is a 3.0-liter turbo 
inline-six that makes 365 hp and 343 lb-ft. A six-speed manual and 
rear-wheel drive are standard; a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional. 
Weight is reduced wherever possible, including 19-inch forged wheels 
shod with specially designed Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires. Beefy brakes aid stopping; 
BMW says 60 mph comes in 4.2 seconds with the automatic.

The M3 is a legend in the world of performance cars, 
giving enthusiasts reason to speak in gushing superlatives 
whenever given the chance. Under the hood is a twin-turbo 
3.0-liter inline-six that makes 425 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque; 
it makes glorious sounds all the way to its 7500-rpm redline. A six-speed manual is 
standard and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional.

Get behind the wheel of the M4 and prepare for explosive performance 
and the M division’s renowned handling capabilities. Power comes 
from a 425-hp twin-turbo inline six-cylinder, mated to either 
a six-speed manual or a paddle-shifted seven-speed automatic and 
rear- or all-wheel drive. To shave weight, many of the M4’s components 
are made of carbon fiber—including the driveshaft. Offered as a coupe 
or convertible, the M4 lives up 
to the legendary performance of the M cars that came before it.

The M5 is a souped-up 5-series sedan that packs a 560-hp twin-turbo V-8 punch.
It comes from a long line of high-performance sedans tuned by BMW’s M division.
Larger and heavier than ever, it remains seriously fast and, 
thanks to sophisticated electronic driving aids, is exceedingly capable on the track. 
The good news: You can get a manual transmission.

BMW’s M6 blends a tasteful yet aggressive design 
with extraordinary performance. 
Power comes from a 560-hp, 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 mated 
to a seven-speed automatic or six-speed manual. 
Offered as a coupe or convertible, 
one might not expect such brutish 
power in what is a comfortable and cosseting car, but that’s exactly why we like it.
 Despite being decidedly more agile than the standard 6-series, the steering and the brakes 
lack 
the feedback needed to make the M6 a proper sports car.

Power comes from a hybrid drivetrain consisting of a 231-horsepower turbocharged 
1.5-liter three-cylinder engine located behind the seats and a 131-horsepower 
electric motor mounted on the front axle. The gas-burning engine sends power 
to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission, while the electric 
motor spins the front wheels through a two-stage automatic gearbox.

The Z4 is a sporty, two-seat ragtop that comes in three flavors. 
The base 2.0-liter four-cylinder sDrive28i is offered with either a 
six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic; there are two 3.0-liter 
twin-turbo sixes: the 300-hp sDrive35i and the 335-hp sDrive35is. 
The former is offered with a six-speed stick or seven-speed dual-clutch auto, 
while the sDrive35is is offered only with the automatic. Regardless of the model, however, 
the Z4 is not one of our favorite sports cars.
